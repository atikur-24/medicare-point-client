              Online Lab Tests are similar to physical laboratory tests except
              that they are booked online instead of making an in-person
              appointment. Moreover, with online lab tests you can get the
              facility of home sample collection from medical labs near you.

              Lab and Essa Laboratory, are available on our platform-MediCare,
